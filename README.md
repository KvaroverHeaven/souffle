[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oracle/souffle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oracle/souffle)

Soufflé is a translator of declarative Datalog programs into the C++ language.  Soufflé is used as a domain-specific language for static program analysis, over large code bases with millions of lines of code.  Soufflé aims at producing high-performance C++ code that can be compiled with the native compiler on the target machine.
